# CoinPaprika Streaming API

The CoinPaprika Streaming API provides high-frequency cryptocurrency ticker data via WebSocket connections, allowing you to get live price updates, market cap changes, and volume data for your favorite cryptocurrencies.

## Getting Started

### 1. Endpoint

Connect to our WebSocket endpoint to start receiving live cryptocurrency data:

```
wss://streaming.coinpaprika.com/ticks
```

### 2. Authentication

All requests require authentication using your API key. You must include it in the `Authorization` header of your WebSocket connection request.

To get your API key, visit the [CoinPaprika API](https://coinpaprika.com/api/) page.

### 3. Finding IDs
*   **Currency IDs (`ids`)**: To subscribe to a currency, you need its unique ID (e.g., `"btc-bitcoin"`). You can find these IDs by using the [Coins endpoint](https://docs.coinpaprika.com/api-reference/coins/get-coin-by-id) from our REST API.
*   **Quote Currencies (`quotes`)**: You can receive prices quoted in various currencies. The currently supported quote currencies are: `USD`, `BTC`, `ETH`, `BNB`, `MATIC`, `SOL`.

## Subscribing to Tickers

Once connected, you can subscribe to or unsubscribe from ticker updates by sending JSON messages.

### Subscribe

To receive updates for one or more cryptocurrencies, send a `subscribe` message:

```json
{
  "event": "subscribe",
  "ids": ["btc-bitcoin", "eth-ethereum"],
  "quotes": ["USD", "BTC"]
}
```

### Unsubscribe

To stop receiving updates, send an `unsubscribe` message:

```json
{
  "event": "unsubscribe",
  "ids": ["btc-bitcoin"]
}
```

## Connection Management (Heartbeat)

The API uses the standard WebSocket ping/pong mechanism to keep connections alive. Your client does not need to send any application-level ping messages.

The server sends a `ping` frame every 120 seconds. Most modern WebSocket client libraries will automatically respond with the required `pong` frame. If the server does not receive a `pong` response, it will assume the connection is stale and close it.

The client examples below demonstrate a robust pattern for handling this by setting a timeout that will terminate and reconnect if a server ping is not received within a certain window.

## Code Examples

### Node.js

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";

const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your API key
const WS_URL = "wss://streaming.coinpaprika.com/ticks";

try {
  const ws = new WebSocket(WS_URL, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: API_KEY,
    },
  });

  let pingTimeout;

  function heartbeat() {
    // Terminate connection if server doesn't send a ping in time
    clearTimeout(pingTimeout);
    console.log("Heartbeat timeout. Terminating connection.");
    ws.terminate();
  }

  ws.on("open", () => {
    console.log("Connection established.");
    pingTimeout = setTimeout(heartbeat, 130 * 1000); // Set initial timeout

    const subscribePayload = {
      event: "subscribe",
      ids: ["btc-bitcoin", "eth-ethereum"],
      quotes: ["USD", "BTC"],
    };

    ws.send(JSON.stringify(subscribePayload));
    console.log("Subscribed to ticker updates for BTC and ETH.");
  });

  ws.on("ping", () => {
    // Server ping received, reset the timeout
    console.log("Received server ping. Resetting heartbeat timeout.");
    clearTimeout(pingTimeout);
    pingTimeout = setTimeout(heartbeat, 130 * 1000); 
  });

  ws.on("message", (data) => {
    console.log("Received message:", JSON.parse(data.toString()));
  });

  ws.on("close", () => {
    console.log("Connection closed.");
    clearTimeout(pingTimeout);
  });

  ws.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("WebSocket error:", err);
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Failed to connect:", e);
}
```

### Python

```python
import websocket
import json
import time
import threading

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your API key
WS_URL = "wss://streaming.coinpaprika.com/ticks"

def on_message(ws, message):
    print(f"Received message: {json.loads(message)}")

def on_error(ws, error):
    print(f"Error: {error}")

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print("### Connection closed ###")

def on_open(ws):
    print("Connection opened.")
    subscribe_payload = {
        "event": "subscribe",
        "ids": ["btc-bitcoin", "eth-ethereum"],
        "quotes": ["USD", "BTC"],
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_payload))
    print("Subscribed to ticker updates for BTC and ETH.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # websocket.enableTrace(True) # Uncomment for debug logging
    ws_app = websocket.WebSocketApp(
        WS_URL,
        header={"Authorization": API_KEY},
        on_open=on_open,
        on_message=on_message,
        on_error=on_error,
        on_close=on_close
    )
    ws_app.run_forever(ping_interval=60, ping_timeout=10)
```

## Message Format

When subscribed, you'll receive live updates in this format:

```json
{
  "id": "btc-bitcoin",
  "sym": "BTC",
  "ts": 1676916987,
  "quotes": {
    "USD": {
      "m": 608286188,
      "p": 50000.123,
      "v24h": 801851299.55
    }
  }
}
```

Where:
- `id`: CoinPaprika currency ID
- `sym`: Currency symbol
- `ts`: Unix timestamp
- `quotes`: Price data in requested quote currencies
  - `m`: Market cap
  - `p`: Current price
  - `v24h`: 24-hour volume

## Rate Limits

- **Quotes per subscription**: Up to 5 quote currencies at once.

## Best Practices

1. **Implement heartbeat monitoring** to ensure a stable connection.
2. **Handle reconnections** gracefully, for example with an exponential backoff strategy.
3. **Subscribe only to needed currencies** to optimize bandwidth.
4. **Store your API token securely** and never expose it in client-side code.
5. **Implement proper error handling** for network issues and connection closures.
