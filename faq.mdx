  <Accordion title="Are there any rate limits?">

  <Accordion title="Can I use your API data commercially?">
    Yes, the data can be used for commercial purposes inside the customer's company in all paid packages. However, only the **Enterprise** package allows data to be redistributed or shared, which requires a dedicated contract.
