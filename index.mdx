## Make your first API call in 3 steps! For free, no credit card required.

<Tip>You can also make requests directly in our API Playground. Visit [GET Ticker by ID](/api-reference/tickers/get-ticker-for-a-specific-coin) to try it out.</Tip>

In the next steps, we will make a GET request to the [Ticker](/api-reference/tickers/get-ticker-for-a-specific-coin) endpoint to get the latest price of Bitcoin (BTC). All you need is the Coin ID.

- Coin ID: `btc-bitcoin`

<Steps>
<Step title="Make a GET request">
Simply make a GET request to the following endpoint to fetch the latest ticker data for any coin. We'll use the Bitcoin ID to populate the endpoint in the format `https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/{coin_id}`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
curl -X GET "https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin"
```
```python python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin")
print(response.json())
```
```javascript javascript
fetch("https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Get latest data for Bitcoin (BTC)">
This will return a detailed response with the latest data for Bitcoin (BTC), which will look similar to this. In the next step, we will extract just the price of BTC in USD.
```json Response [expandable]
{
    "id": "btc-bitcoin",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "rank": 1,
    "total_supply": 19883231,

            "percent_change_12h": 0.92,
            "percent_change_24h": 1.74,
            "percent_change_7d": 2.27,
            "percent_change_30d": -2.88,
            "percent_change_1y": 73.78,
            "ath_price": 111923.79452175781,
            "ath_date": "2025-05-22T18:42:03Z",
            "percent_from_price_ath": -4.33
        }
    }
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Extract the price">
The response contains rich data. You can extract the USD price by navigating to the `quotes.USD.price` field. Here is how you can modify the request to get just the price:
<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
curl -s "https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin" | jq '.quotes.USD.price'
```
```python python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin")
price = response.json()["quotes"]["USD"]["price"]
print(price)
```
```javascript javascript
fetch("https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/btc-bitcoin")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    const price = data.quotes.USD.price;
    console.log(price);
  });
```
</CodeGroup>
And as a result, you will get the price of BTC in USD:
```json quotes.USD.price
107077.69661924685
```
Congratulations! You've successfully retrieved the latest price of Bitcoin!
