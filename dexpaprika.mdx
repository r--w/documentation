## Introducing DexPaprika

As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, so do the needs of developers and analysts. While CoinPaprika provides comprehensive market data for thousands of assets across centralized exchanges, the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and on-chain activity requires a specialized set of tools.

To meet this demand, we are proud to introduce our sister project: **DexPaprika**.
